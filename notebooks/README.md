# Notebooks Directory Structure

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks organized by purpose and workflow stage.

## Folder Structure

### üìÅ `eda/`
Exploratory Data Analysis notebooks:
- Data exploration and visualization
- Statistical analysis
- Pattern discovery
- Feature correlation analysis

### üìÅ `modeling/`
Model training and evaluation notebooks:
- Baseline model development
- Algorithm-specific implementations
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model comparison

### üìÅ `experiments/`
Experimental notebooks and prototypes:
- Feature engineering experiments
- Advanced techniques testing
- Model ensemble development
- Quick prototyping and testing

## Current Files

- `eda/eda_analysis.ipynb` - Comprehensive exploratory data analysis
- `modeling/baseline_modeling.ipynb` - Random Forest baseline model

## Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive names indicating purpose
- Include version numbers for iterative work
- Examples:
  - `feature_engineering_v2.ipynb`
  - `xgboost_tuning_v1.ipynb`
  - `ensemble_stacking_experiment.ipynb`

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Organize by purpose** - Keep notebooks in appropriate folders
2. **Clear documentation** - Use markdown cells to explain methodology
3. **Reproducible code** - Set random seeds and document dependencies
4. **Version control** - Use meaningful commit messages for notebook changes
